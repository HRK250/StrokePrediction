In this project, our aim is to identify the factors that increase the chances of having a stroke. We will be analyzing a dataset consisting of 11 clinical features (columns) to explore if there is any correlation between pre-existing health factors and stroke. Furthermore, we will investigate if there are any environmental factors that contribute to the likelihood of having a stroke. The dataset has already been collected and partially pre-processed, with unknown values in the smoking column and NA values in the BMI column. These issues will be addressed during the data processing phase of the project. The dataset consists of 5110 observations, with slightly more females than males.

We have chosen this dataset because stroke is the second leading cause of death, responsible for around 11% of the world's population. Our main research question is whether any factor in the dataset affects the chances of having a stroke. To answer this question, we will group similar variables together and use observations in the clinical features (columns).
